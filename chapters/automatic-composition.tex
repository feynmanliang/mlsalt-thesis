\subsection{Monophonic melody modeling}

Following the natural process undertaken by many human composers, we divided
the music generation task into two subproblems:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generating a melody line $\vec{m}$
    \item Given a fixed melody line, generate the four voices $\{\vec{v}_i\}_{i=1}^4$ (solved in chorale harmonization)
\end{enumerate}

Sample a melody m $\sim$ P(m) where P(m) is given by a LSTM, then load up 4
encoder/decoder biLSTMs (one for each voice) with m and get their MAP outputs

Equivalent to language modeling problem. Goal is to model $P(\vec{m})$ for $\vec{m}
\in V^T$, $T \in \NN$. LSTM architecture can capture longer range dependencies.

\subsection{Polyphonic modeling}

We use a 2-layer LSTM with a 128-dimensional word embedding.
