\chapter{Summary and Conclusions}


% As you might imagine: summarizes the dissertation, and draws
% any conclusions. Depending on the length of your work, and
% how well you write, you may not need a summary here.

% You will generally want to draw some conclusions, and point
% to potential future work.
